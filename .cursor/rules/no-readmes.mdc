Policy: No README Generation

You must not create or modify any README files (e.g., README.md, README, README.txt) or auto-generate documentation files unless I explicitly ask for it in the current prompt.

What to do instead
	•	If you feel documentation is needed, add concise inline code comments or JSDoc near the code being changed.
	•	If I explicitly request documentation, ask where to put it (e.g., /docs/), and keep it minimal and task-scoped.

Enforcement Checklist (run before proposing changes)
	•	Are you about to create or edit README* or docs/*.md? → Stop and skip.
	•	Limit any “documentation” to inline comments or test descriptions unless I asked otherwise.
